            <li>Hot Water ( approximately 70*C, or 158 *F)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill two thirds of a gourd (the bowl where the mate is taken) with mate.</li>
            <li>Then, make a mound on one side of the gourd and pour warm or hot water up to the mouth.</li>
            <li>Wait 5 minutes before drinking to allow time for the herb to swell.</li>
            <li>The first sip should be spit out because it always comes with a little mate powder.</li>
            <li>If you want to repeat, you don't need to add more mate, just fill the gourd with water again.</li>
        </ol>
